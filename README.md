# Database-systems

Data Management Systems (including Relational Databases, Non-Relational Databases, and NoSQL storage systems) form the basis of the Big Data Economy we now live in. 

A data management system is responsible for storing data, enabling efficient access to that data, as well as mediating concurrent modifications. The programming assignment involves building a system that answers SQL queries efficiently. 

This project addresses

    ... how to efficiently store and retrieve data programatically.
    ... how to optimize big-data computations.
    ... how to use index structures to accelerate computations.
    ... how to safely and efficiently manipulate data concurrently.
    ... how to recover state after software and hardware failures.
    ... how to query and update distributed data consistently.
